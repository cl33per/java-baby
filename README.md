### Summary

This is a living repositiory for each development language and projects. Attempting to use best naming convention with Git i.e. GitFlow without using the plugin as it seems to be last used 2012. 

Git Branchs and their flow should follow:
 
Master 

Davelop/stagging

Develop/**language**/**project**

Develop/stagging> git merge --no-ff Develop/**language**/**project**

Master> git merge --no-ff Develop/stagging

Attempting to only have deveop/stagging merge --no-ff with Master for best practice in Git branch & commit flow. 

Hotfix Branch -- not currently being used.

If you stumble across this repo I welcome feedback and ideas.
